# chase.md — North Star

## Mission

**Get accountants' clients to send their stuff — automatically, intelligently, compliantly.**

## The Problem

UK accountancy practices waste 500-750 hours/year chasing clients for tax documents. With MTD ITSA launching April 2026, this becomes 2,000-4,500 hours/year. No tool solves this intelligently. Every competitor sends dumb email templates on a schedule.

## The Insight

This is a **client experience problem** disguised as a productivity problem. Fix the client's experience (make it easy, clear, mobile, WhatsApp-native) and the accountant's problem disappears.

## The Product

An AI-powered document chasing engine that:
1. **Knows** what each client needs to send (document checklists by client type)
2. **Chases** intelligently across email + WhatsApp (right channel, right tone, right time)
3. **Receives** documents via a frictionless upload portal (no login, mobile-first, progress bar)
4. **Recognises** what's been received (AI document classification)
5. **Tracks** everything in a single dashboard (the practice's chase.md)

## The Moat

- **WhatsApp-first** — nobody else does accountant→client WhatsApp chasing. First mover.
- **AI-native** — document recognition, tone adaptation, predictive timing. Not bolted on.
- **Client UX** — magic links, progress bars, help guides. Competitors have portals from 2015.
- **chase.md as a standard** — the file format becomes the industry convention.

## Market Timing

- MTD ITSA Phase 1: **6 April 2026** (49 days)
- First quarterly chasing wave: **July 2026**
- Target MVP live: **May 2026**
- Chasing burden multiplier: **3-6x** across the profession

## Success Looks Like

**Month 3:** 10 practices using chase.md. First case study published. £1,490 MRR.

**Month 12:** 150 practices. Xero App Marketplace listing. £22K MRR. Austin full-time on chase.md.

**Month 24:** 800 practices. £119K MRR. Expanding to legal/IFA verticals. chase.md is the industry standard for document collection.

## Principles

1. **Client experience first.** If the client finds it easy, the accountant wins automatically.
2. **Do one thing brilliantly.** We chase documents. We don't do practice management, invoicing, or bookkeeping.
3. **WhatsApp is the channel.** Email is backup. Build for where clients actually are.
4. **Ship fast, learn fast.** MVP in 8 weeks. Perfect is the enemy of live.
5. **AI is the differentiator, not the marketing.** Accountants don't buy "AI" — they buy "97 hours saved."
6. **chase.md is a file, a product, and a standard.** The name IS the product.
