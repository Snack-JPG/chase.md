# chase.md — Sales Deck

> *For practice owner conversations. Not an investor deck.*

## Slide 1: Title

<!-- VISUAL: Dark background, large "chase.md" logo in monospace font. Single line underneath. Clean, modern, no clutter. -->

# chase.md

### Your clients send their documents. Automatically.

*Intelligent document chasing for UK accountancy practices*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

<!-- VISUAL: Big red number "637" centre-stage. Below it, a row of icons: email, phone, sticky note, spreadsheet — all the manual ways practices chase today. -->

### You already know this pain.

**637 hours per year.** That's the average UK practice chasing clients for documents.

- 📧 "Just a reminder to send your P60…" ×200 clients ×4 reminders each
- 📞 Phone calls that go to voicemail
- 📋 Spreadsheets tracking who sent what
- 😤 Staff who'd rather do *actual accounting*

**Every practice does this. No one's solved it.**

That's **£945M** in wasted time across the profession — and with MTD ITSA landing in **49 days**, the chasing burden is about to **4x**.

> *"We spend more time chasing documents than we do processing them."*
> — Every practice owner, every January

## Slide 3: The Solution

<!-- VISUAL: Three channel icons (email → SMS → WhatsApp) flowing left to right with arrows between them. Below: phone mockup showing the upload portal. Right side: AI brain icon classifying a document. -->

### chase.md handles the chasing. You handle the accounting.

**Intelligent multi-channel chasing:**
- Starts with **email** → escalates to **SMS** → then **WhatsApp**
- Right message, right tone, right time — automatically
- Gentle → Reminder → Firm → Urgent — no awkward conversations

**AI document recognition:**
- Client uploads a file → chase.md knows what it is
- P60? Bank statement? Self-assessment? ✅ Matched instantly
- No manual sorting. No "what's this file?"

**No-login client portal:**
- Client gets a magic link → tap → upload → done
- No passwords. No app downloads. No "I can't log in" calls
- Mobile-first. Works on any phone. 60-second experience.

## Slide 4: How It Works

<!-- VISUAL: Three numbered circles (1-2-3) connected by a dotted line, each with an icon and short description. Clean horizontal flow. -->

### Three steps. Five minutes to set up.

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **1** | **2** | **3** |
| 🔗 | 👥 | 🚀 |
| **Connect your practice** | **Import your clients** | **chase.md handles the rest** |
| Sign up, set your branding, choose your channels | CSV upload or type them in — name, email, phone | Automatic chasing, smart escalation, real-time tracking |

That's it. No 6-week onboarding. No training days. No IT department.

---

## Slide 5: The Product

<!-- VISUAL: Three browser/phone mockups side by side showing each screen. Dashboard on left (desktop), portal in centre (mobile), timeline on right (desktop). -->

### What you'll actually see every day

**🖥️ Practice Dashboard**
- Bird's-eye view: how many documents outstanding, who's responded, who hasn't
- Filter by campaign (SA tax return, MTD Q1, VAT return)
- Red/amber/green status for every client
- "37 of 200 clients have sent everything" — at a glance

**📱 Client Portal** *(what your clients see)*
- Clean, branded page: "Smith & Co needs these documents from you"
- Checklist with tick marks: P60 ✅ | Bank statements ⬜ | Mortgage interest ⬜
- Drag and drop upload — works on phone, no app needed
- Progress bar: "You're 60% done!"

**📊 Chase Timeline**
- Every chase for every client — email sent, opened, link clicked, document uploaded
- See exactly where each client is in the escalation sequence
- "Sarah was chased 3 times by email, then once by WhatsApp — uploaded everything 4 minutes later"

## Slide 6: Market Size

<!-- VISUAL: Large UK map outline with "15,000-20,000" in the centre. Below: MTD ITSA timeline graphic showing April 2026 deadline with "4x" burst graphic. -->

### The timing couldn't be better.

**15,000–20,000 UK accountancy practices** manage SA/Ltd/VAT clients who need to send documents every year.

**Average practice:** 200-1,000 clients. Each needing 3-8 documents per engagement.

**Then MTD ITSA hits — April 2026:**
- Quarterly digital submissions (not annual)
- 4x the chasing cycles per year
- Every self-employed client with income >£50K affected in Phase 1
- Practices are *panicking*. ICAEW and ACCA are running emergency webinars.

| | Before MTD | After MTD |
|---|---|---|
| Chasing cycles/year | 1-2 | 4-5 |
| Hours spent chasing | 500-750 | 2,000-4,500 |
| Staff stress level | 😤 | 🔥 |

**chase.md turns a 4x problem into a solved problem.**

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape

<!-- VISUAL: Comparison table with competitors down the left, features across the top. chase.md row highlighted in green with ticks everywhere. Competitors have X marks on key features. -->

### Everyone else sends dumb email templates on a timer.

| Feature | **chase.md** | Senta | Karbon | BrightManager |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Multi-channel (Email + SMS + WhatsApp) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| AI document recognition | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Smart escalation (tone + channel) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No-login client portal | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mobile-first upload | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Magic links (no passwords) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Built for UK practices | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-practice pricing (not per-user) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**The difference:** Competitors bolt "request info" onto practice management tools. We built *the entire product* around the one thing that wastes the most time.

## Slide 8: Pricing & ROI

<!-- VISUAL: Three pricing cards side by side (Starter/Growth/Practice). Below: ROI calculation in a highlighted box showing the 14x return. -->

### Pays for itself in the first week.

| Starter | Growth | Practice |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **£79/mo** | **£149/mo** | **£249/mo** |
| Up to 100 clients | Up to 500 clients | Unlimited clients |
| Email + SMS | + WhatsApp | + AI classification |
| 1 campaign type | Unlimited campaigns | + Priority support |

**Per practice. Not per user.** Your whole team uses it.

### The ROI is absurd:

> **637 hours saved** × £20/hr average staff cost = **£12,740/year saved**
>
> chase.md Growth plan = **£1,788/year**
>
> **That's a 14x return.** Before you count the reduced client complaints, faster turnaround, and happier staff.

## Slide 10: The Builder

<!-- VISUAL: Professional photo of Austin. Key stats in large text beside the photo. No corporate waffle. -->

### Built by someone who understands both sides.

**Austin Mander, 21**

- Built a **550,000-line enterprise SaaS platform** (Change Radar) — solo
- Grew up with AI — not learning it, *building with it*
- Currently working in engineering at Gühring — shipping while bootstrapping
- **Stepdad is a chartered accountant** — first beta user, built-in credibility, real-world feedback loop

This isn't a team of consultants who read about accountancy. This is someone who's watched the document chasing problem from the kitchen table for years — and finally built the fix.

---

## Slide 11: What We're Looking For

<!-- VISUAL: Simple, direct. Large text centre-stage. No clutter. Maybe a handshake icon. -->

### We're not asking for money. We're asking for 30 minutes.

**We need 5 beta practices** to test chase.md with real clients before public launch.

**What you get:**
- 🆓 Free for the entire beta period (3 months)
- 🎯 Direct line to the builder — features built around your needs
- 🏷️ Founding practice pricing locked in forever (50% off)
- 📣 First case study — "Practice X saved 400 hours with chase.md"

**What we need from you:**
- A real client list (50+ clients)
- One active chasing campaign (SA returns, MTD prep, whatever's live)
- 15 minutes of feedback per week
- Honesty about what works and what doesn't

**Risk: zero.** If it doesn't work, you've lost nothing. If it does, you've just got your evenings back.
