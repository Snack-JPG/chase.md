# chase.md — Objection Handling Guide

> **For:** Austin's real conversations with practice owners
> **Rule:** Listen first, acknowledge the concern, then respond. Never argue.

---

## 1. "You're 21 — why should I trust you?"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm risking my practice on someone who might not be around in a year."

**Response:** "Totally fair question. I'd ask the same thing. Two things — I've already built and shipped a 550,000-line enterprise SaaS product called Change Radar, so this isn't my first rodeo. And my stepdad's a chartered accountant — he's our first user. I'm not building this from the outside looking in. I grew up around tax season chaos. The age thing actually works in your favour — I've got no legacy thinking, no 'this is how we've always done it.' And I'm not burning VC cash. I charge from day one, which means I only survive if you get value."

**Follow-up:** "What would you need to see to feel comfortable? A trial period? A reference from another practice?"

---

## 2. "We already use Senta/Karbon/BrightManager"

**What they're really saying:** "We've already invested time and money in a system. Switching is painful."

**Response:** "Good — you should keep using them. Senta and Karbon are brilliant for practice management, workflows, CRM. We don't replace any of that. chase.md does one thing they don't do well: intelligent multi-channel document chasing. Your practice management tool sends email templates on a schedule. We chase across WhatsApp and email, escalate the tone automatically, give clients a mobile upload portal, and use AI to classify what comes back. Think of it as a specialist tool that plugs the gap in your existing stack."

**Follow-up:** "Out of curiosity, how are you chasing documents right now within Senta/Karbon? Is it mostly email templates?"

---

## 3. "We just use email templates and it's fine"

**What they're really saying:** "It works well enough. The pain isn't bad enough to justify change."

**Response:** "If it's genuinely working, I wouldn't change it. But let me ask — what's your response rate on first chase? Because across the practices I've spoken to, email chase gets about a 20-30% open rate. WhatsApp gets 90%+. The other thing is — email templates don't escalate. They send the same tone whether it's the first chase or the fifth. And they definitely don't know when a client has already sent half their documents. How many hours a week does your team spend manually following up after the template's gone out and got nothing back?"

**Follow-up:** "If I could show you the difference in response rates on a small batch of clients — say 20 — would that be worth trying?"

---

## 4. "Our clients won't like being chased by AI"

**What they're really saying:** "We pride ourselves on personal relationships. This feels cold and impersonal."

**Response:** "Your clients won't know it's AI — and that's the point. Every message goes out under your practice name, your branding, your tone. It looks exactly like your team sent it. The difference is your team didn't have to spend 20 minutes writing and sending it. And honestly, the experience for your client is *better* — they get a WhatsApp with a clear list of what's needed, a one-tap link to upload from their phone, and a progress bar showing what's done. No logging into a portal, no remembering passwords. Most clients prefer this to a formal email they ignore."

**Follow-up:** "What does your chasing process look like today? Is it one person doing it or spread across the team?"

---

## 5. "What about data security / GDPR?"

**What they're really saying:** "We handle sensitive financial data. One breach and we're finished."

**Response:** "I take this as seriously as you do. Here's the specifics: all data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Documents are stored on Cloudflare R2 — enterprise-grade, ISO 27001 certified infrastructure. Each practice's data is completely isolated. We have full GDPR compliance built in — consent management for WhatsApp, opt-out handling, audit logs for every action, data export, and right-to-deletion. Every document upload, every message sent, every consent change is logged with timestamps. We've also got virus scanning on every upload and magic links that expire. You can see the full audit trail in your dashboard."

**Follow-up:** "Would it help if I walked you through our security model? I can show you exactly how data flows and where it's stored."

---

## 6. "We're too busy to onboard a new tool"

**What they're really saying:** "We're drowning already. Adding something new feels like more work, not less."

**Response:** "That's exactly why you need it — because you're too busy *chasing*. Onboarding takes about 30 minutes. You import your client list — CSV or we'll pull from Xero — pick which documents you need for each client type, and hit go. There's no workflow to design, no templates to write. We've got pre-built checklists for SA, CT, VAT, MTD. The whole point is that 30 minutes now saves you hundreds of hours over tax season. And with MTD ITSA hitting in April, your chasing volume is about to triple. Better to set this up now than in July when you're drowning."

**Follow-up:** "When's your busiest chasing period? We could get you set up before it hits."

## 7. "We already use ChatGPT for this stuff"

**What they're really saying:** "AI is commoditised. Why pay for yours when I can prompt my own?"

**Response:** "ChatGPT's great for drafting a chase email. But that's 1% of the problem. The other 99% is: knowing which clients need chasing, tracking what's been received, sending at the right time, escalating the tone, switching channels when email gets ignored, handling opt-outs, giving clients somewhere easy to upload, and classifying what comes back. chase.md is an engine, not a copywriter. You wouldn't use ChatGPT to run your payroll even though it could explain how payroll works. Same thing here — it's the automation and orchestration that saves you time, not the words."

**Follow-up:** "How much time does your team spend on the chasing *process* beyond just writing the message?"

---

## 8. "WhatsApp feels too informal for accountancy"

**What they're really saying:** "We're professionals. We don't want to look like a takeaway sending order updates."

**Response:** "I completely get that. But here's the reality — your clients are already on WhatsApp all day. They check it 80+ times a day. They check email maybe twice. The formality isn't in the channel, it's in the message. Our templates are professional, clear, branded to your practice. No emojis unless you want them. And here's the killer stat — WhatsApp gets a 90%+ open rate versus 20-30% for email. That's the difference between chasing once and chasing six times. The practices that have tried it say clients actually *thank them* for making it easy. You can always use email-only if you prefer — but I'd suggest trying WhatsApp with 20 clients and seeing the difference."

**Follow-up:** "What if we started email-only and added WhatsApp later once you've seen how the system works?"

---

## 9. "What if it annoys our clients and they leave?"

**What they're really saying:** "Client retention is everything. I'd rather chase manually than risk losing a client."

**Response:** "This is the number one thing I designed around. The chase engine has built-in safeguards — it respects business hours, skips weekends and bank holidays, spaces messages out (you set the gap, default is 7 days), and escalates gradually from gentle to firm. There's a maximum chase limit per client. And any client can reply STOP to opt out instantly — we handle that automatically, GDPR compliant. But here's the thing — what actually annoys clients isn't being chased. It's being chased *badly*. Getting the same generic email five times. Not knowing what they've already sent. Having to log into a clunky portal. chase.md fixes the *experience* of being chased, which is why clients respond faster and complain less."

**Follow-up:** "Have you ever lost a client specifically because of chasing? Or is it more a general worry?"

## 10. "We need integration with Xero/Sage/IRIS"

**What they're really saying:** "If it doesn't fit our existing stack, it's a non-starter."

**Response:** "Xero integration is in the MVP — you'll be able to pull your client list directly, sync contact details, and map tax obligations. Sage is on the roadmap for month two. IRIS is a bit further out because their API is... let's say 'characterful'... but it's coming. For now, any system works via CSV import — takes two minutes. The key thing is chase.md doesn't need deep accounting integration. We need your client list and their contact details. We're not touching your accounts, ledgers, or tax submissions. We're the chasing layer that sits on top."

**Follow-up:** "Which system are you on? I can tell you exactly where we are with that integration."

---

## 11. "What's the ROI? Prove it."

**What they're really saying:** "I need to justify this spend. Show me the numbers."

**Response:** "Let's do your numbers right now. How many SA clients do you have? [Let them answer.] OK, so the industry average is 3-5 hours per year per client on document chasing. At, say, 300 SA clients, that's 900-1,500 hours a year. At even £25/hour for admin staff time, that's £22,000-£37,000 in chasing costs. chase.md at £149/month is £1,788 a year. Even if we only save you 30% of that chasing time, you're saving £6,000-£11,000 against a £1,788 cost. And that's before MTD ITSA, which multiplies your chasing burden by 3-6x because you're chasing quarterly instead of annually. The question isn't whether you can afford chase.md — it's whether you can afford not to have it when MTD hits."

**Follow-up:** "Want me to run the specific numbers for your practice size? Takes two minutes."

## 12. "Can we try it for free?"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm interested but not ready to commit money before I've seen it work."

**Response:** "Absolutely. We do a 14-day free trial, full features, no card upfront. Import your clients, run a campaign, see the response rates. Most practices see the difference within the first week — clients start uploading within hours of the first WhatsApp going out. After that, Starter is £79/month, and you can cancel anytime. No contracts, no lock-in. If it doesn't save you time, don't pay for it."

**Follow-up:** "Want to get that set up now? I can have you live in 30 minutes."

---

## 13. "We're a small practice, do we really need this?"

**What they're really saying:** "This sounds like a tool for big firms. We only have 50/100 clients."

**Response:** "Small practices actually get the *most* value from this. In a big firm, they've got dedicated admin teams for chasing. In a small practice, it's usually the partners doing it themselves — which means the most expensive people in the firm are doing the lowest-value work. If you've got 100 SA clients and you're spending even 2 hours per client chasing, that's 200 hours a year. At partner rates, that's £20,000+ of your time. For £79 a month. And with MTD, even a sole trader practice with 50 clients is going to be chasing quarterly — that's 200 chase cycles a year instead of 50."

**Follow-up:** "How many clients do you have on SA right now? And who in the practice does most of the chasing?"

---

## 14. "What happens to our data if you go bust?"

**What they're really saying:** "You're a startup. Startups fail. I need to know my clients' data is safe."

**Response:** "Smart question — and one most people don't think to ask. First, we're bootstrapped and profitable from early on. No VC burn rate, no 'run out of funding' risk. But even so — your data is always yours. You can export everything at any time from your dashboard: full client list, document archive, audit logs, the lot. If chase.md ever shut down, you'd get 90 days notice and full data export. It's in the terms. And your documents sit on Cloudflare R2 — standard infrastructure that doesn't disappear because one company does. Practically speaking though, I'm not going anywhere. This is my company, I'm 21, and I've got decades of runway ahead of me."

**Follow-up:** "Would it help to see the data export feature? I can show you exactly what you'd get."

## General Tips

**Listen more than you talk.** The best response to an objection is often "Tell me more about that." The underlying concern is usually different from what they say.

**Never dismiss.** Every objection is valid to them. "That's a great question" isn't sycophantic if you mean it.

**Use their numbers.** When they tell you their client count or team size, do the ROI calculation on the spot. Their own numbers are 10x more convincing than yours.

**The MTD card.** Every practice knows MTD ITSA is coming. Every practice is worried about it. It's the strongest urgency lever you have. April 2026 is immovable.

**Social proof compounds.** Once you have 3 practices, reference them (with permission). "We're working with [X practice] in [town] and they saw Y result" closes deals faster than any argument.

**End every conversation with a next step.** Never leave it at "I'll think about it." Always propose something concrete: a trial, a demo, a follow-up call with a specific date.
