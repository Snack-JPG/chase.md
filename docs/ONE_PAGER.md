### Your clients send their documents. Automatically.

---

## The Problem

Your practice spends **500-750 hours/year** chasing clients for documents. With MTD ITSA hitting **April 2026**, that becomes **2,000-4,500 hours**. Every reminder email, every voicemail, every "I'll send it next week" — it's the biggest time sink in your practice and no tool properly solves it.

## The Solution

**chase.md** is an AI-powered document chasing engine built specifically for UK accountancy practices.

| Intelligent Chasing | Client Portal | Practice Dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| Email → SMS → WhatsApp | Magic link, no login needed | Real-time status for every client |
| Smart escalation (gentle → firm) | Mobile-first, 60-second upload | Filter by campaign, red/amber/green |
| Right channel, right tone, right time | Progress bar + document checklist | Full chase timeline per client |

## How It Works

**1. Connect** your practice (5 min setup) → **2. Import** your clients (CSV or manual) → **3. chase.md handles the rest** — automatic chasing, smart escalation, document recognition.

## Why chase.md?

- **Multi-channel** — Email, SMS, and WhatsApp. No one else does this.
- **AI-native** — Recognises uploaded documents automatically. No manual sorting.
- **No-login portal** — Magic links mean zero "I can't log in" support calls.
- **Built for MTD** — Quarterly chasing cycles, ready for April 2026.
